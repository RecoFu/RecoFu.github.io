# System Guardian Philosophy

## Three Layers of Sovereignty

### Layer 1: Physical Sovereignty
- INT 21h register-level debugging
- Oscilloscope waveform analysis
- PCI protocol reverse engineering
- Hardware failure root cause analysis

### Layer 2: Infrastructure Truth
- National financial backbone (Taiwan Stock Exchange, ATM networks)
- 3G core center architecture
- Zero-breach, zero-loss operational record
- 40-year proven stability

### Layer 3: Data Sovereignty
- 9-year autonomous system resilience proof
- Perfect log integrity (SHA-256 verification)
- Black swan stress testing
- AI logic sparring & hallucination prevention

## Core Principle

> When mainstream tools fail, this is where real diagnosis begins.

Not theory. Not optimization. **Root causes only.**
