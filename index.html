## 1. Professional Narrative | 職涯核心敘事
### EN
Forty years of battling system entropy. From FidoNet (1984) to AI-driven automation (2025), I don’t just build systems; I ensure their survival in hostile environments. My track record is defined by **Zero Data Loss** and **Zero Ransomware Payments** over four decades of operation.
### 中
對抗系統「熵增」的四十載。從 1984 年的 FidoNet 到 2025 年的 AI 自動化治理，我不僅是建置者，更是極端環境下的生存專家。我的職業生涯定義於一個極致指標：**從業四十年，數據零遺失、勒索軟體零支付。**

## 2. Infrastructure & Critical Incidents | 關鍵技術實績與防禦
### [1984 - 2003] The Protocol Era (協議與骨幹時期)
*   **FidoNet Node 6:722/228 (1993-2000):** Independent node operator in Taichung. Mastered low-level protocol security before the modern internet.
*   **Military Logic Transformation:** Digitized the entire testing and database system for the Army Engineering School (精實專案).
*   **National Backbone:** Deployed T1/ATM backbones for Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) and Central Trust Bureau. Built the first 3G Core in Central Taiwan.
### [2010 - 2022] Overseas Crisis Management (跨國危機處理)
*   **2015 Ransomware Defense (Cambodia):** Eradicated infection and restored ERP within 8 hours. **Result: Zero ransom paid, Zero data lost.**
*   **2016 Root Cause Diagnostics (LF Co.):** Independently identified a Broadcom VMQ driver bug causing random cluster crashes. Overturned previous misdiagnoses from Tier-1 vendors.

## 3. Quantitative Execution & Hard Evidence | 量化交易與數據證實
**Condition:** Unattended execution (Home system in Taichung) while I was deployed in Thailand/Vietnam/Cambodia. Surviving earthquakes, typhoons, and power outages.

## 4. The AI Frontier (2022 - Present) | AI 治理與安全
*   **GDI (Guardian Defense Interface):** Custom-developed real-time environment protection system.
*   **LLM Integration:** Seamless ChatGPT API orchestration into legacy ERP/MIS flows, reducing vulnerability surface by 75%.
*   **Conclusion:** The end of "Hive-mind Quant" in 2020/3/18 marked the funeral of old paradigms; I have transitioned to AI-Governance-Core execution.
