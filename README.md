## 1. Professional Narrative | 職涯核心敘事
**EN:** Forty years of battling system entropy. From FidoNet (1984) to AI-driven automation (2025), I ensure survival in hostile environments. Zero Data Loss. Zero Ransomware Payments.  
**中:** 對抗系統「熵增」四十載。從 1984 年 FidoNet 到 2025 年 AI 自動化治理，我是極端環境下的生存專家。數據零遺失，勒索零支付。

## 2. Critical Incidents | 關鍵技術實績
**[1984 - 2003] Protocol Era / 協議骨幹期**
- FidoNet Node 6:722/228, Taichung: Independent node operation, low-level protocol mastery.
- Army Engineering School: Digitized testing & database systems.
- TWSE & Central Trust: Deployed T1/ATM backbone, built first 3G core in Central Taiwan.

**[2010 - 2022] Overseas Crisis Management / 跨國危機處理**
- 2015 Cambodia Ransomware Defense: Restored ERP in 8 hours. Zero ransom, zero data lost.
- 2016 LF Co.: Diagnosed Broadcom VMQ driver bug causing cluster crashes. Corrected prior vendor misdiagnosis.

## 3. Quantitative Execution | 量化交易與數據證實
Condition: Unattended execution at home system, surviving natural disasters.
